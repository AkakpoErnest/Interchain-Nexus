# Governance Integration

## Overview
Governance in the Interchain Nexus represents the collective decision-making process across all blockchain ecosystems. It combines on-chain voting, consensus mechanisms, and community governance.

## Pioneer: The Consensus Weaver
- **Name**: The Consensus Weaver
- **Title**: Harmonizer
- **Realm**: Governance
- **Rarity**: Legendary
- **Specialty**: Consensus mechanisms and governance protocols

## Technical Integration

### Multi-Chain Governance
- **Cross-Chain Voting**: Vote across multiple blockchains
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Various consensus algorithms
- **Governance Tokens**: Token-based voting power
- **Proposal Systems**: Create and manage governance proposals

### Smart Contract Features
```solidity
// Governance integration for Consensus Weaver
contract GovernanceCouncil {
    // Multi-chain voting mechanisms
    // Proposal creation and management
    // Consensus algorithm implementation
    // Cross-chain governance coordination
}
```

### Game Integration
- **Puzzle Type**: Council Chambers (Voting and consensus)
- **Mechanism**: Cast votes and participate in governance
- **Reward**: Council Mark Card
- **Bonus**: +15% success rate on ALL puzzles (universal bonus)

### Key Features
1. **Multi-Chain Voting**: Vote across Base, ENS, Filecoin, Flare
2. **Consensus Algorithms**: Proof of Stake, Delegated Proof of Stake
3. **Governance Tokens**: INX (Interchain Nexus) governance token
4. **Proposal System**: Create and vote on game improvements

### Development Tools
- **Snapshot**: Off-chain voting platform
- **Tally**: On-chain governance dashboard
- **OpenZeppelin**: Governance contract templates
- **Compound**: Governance protocol reference

### Governance Mechanisms
```javascript
// Governance voting example
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const governance = new ethers.Contract(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS, GOVERNANCE_ABI, provider);

// Create proposal
const proposalTx = await governance.propose(
    targets,
    values,
    calldatas,
    description
);

// Vote on proposal
const voteTx = await governance.castVote(proposalId, support);
```

### Governance Features
- **Proposal Creation**: Create governance proposals
- **Voting Power**: Based on INX token holdings
- **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to others
- **Execution**: Execute approved proposals

### Puzzle Mechanics
1. **Voting Challenges**: Participate in governance votes
2. **Consensus Building**: Build consensus across communities
3. **Proposal Creation**: Create governance proposals
4. **Cross-Chain Coordination**: Coordinate governance across chains

### Consensus Algorithms
- **Proof of Stake**: Stake tokens to participate
- **Delegated Proof of Stake**: Delegate to validators
- **Quadratic Voting**: Prevent whale dominance
- **Futarchy**: Prediction market-based governance

### Governance Tokens
- **INX Token**: Interchain Nexus governance token
- **Voting Power**: Proportional to token holdings
- **Staking Rewards**: Earn rewards for participation
- **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to experts
