# Symbiotic Shared Security Protocol Integration

## Overview
Symbiotic is a shared security protocol that creates a marketplace for economic security. It enables networks that need security to access it from those who have assets to stake, creating an efficient ecosystem where stake can be shared across multiple networks.

## Pioneer: The Security Architect

### Shared Security Examples
```javascript
// Symbiotic shared security example
import { SymbioticProvider } from '@symbiotic/sdk';

const provider = new SymbioticProvider();
const vault = new SymbioticVault(provider);

// Create shared security vault
await vault.createVault({
  networkId: 'ethereum',
  securityRequirement: 1000000, // 1M tokens
  rewardRate: 0.05 // 5% APY
});

// Stake in shared security
await vault.stake(amount, networkId);
```
